Teriyaki Chicken Meal for Weekdays

1. Preheat the oven to 400ยบ F (200ยบC).
2. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, whisk together the soy sauce, water, garlic, cornstarch, and honey. Allow the sauce to begin bubbling, then stir until sauce thickens. Remove from the heat.
3. Spoon a little of the teriyaki sauce onto the center of a large parchment-lined baking sheet. Lay the chicken on top of the sauce. Arrange the bell pepper, broccoli, green beans, and carrots out on either side of the chicken.
4. Season the vegetables and chicken with salt and pepper to taste. Coat everything well with teriyaki sauce, reserving some for later.
5. Bake for 20 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through and juices run clear.
6. Remove the pan from oven and let cool. Slice the chicken into strips.
7. Distribute the chicken and vegetables evenly between 4 resealable containers filled with brown rice, separating vegetables for 4 different dishes, if desired.
8. Drizzle the remaining sauce over chicken and garnish with sesame seeds and green onion.
